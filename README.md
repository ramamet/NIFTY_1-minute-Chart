# NIFTY_1-minute-Chart

###### NIFTY index chart , period of 2012 to 2016

      Now that the NSE,India market has opened. the first noticeable increment of time is the first few minutes.  
      I have no study to back this one up, but from my own experience the 1-minute and 5-minute charts are by far the most 
      popular time frame. Within the time frame 1-minute we can see a number of spikes in price as stocks gap up or down 
      from the previous days close. 

      Here I have collected NSE BANK index and NIFTY50 index for the period of 2012 to 2016. Shiny app is also developed to 
      process the dataset.
