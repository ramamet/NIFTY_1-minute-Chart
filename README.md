# NIFTY_1-minute-Chart

###### NIFTY index chart , period of 2012 to 2016

 Now that the NSE,India market has opened at 9:15 hour (IST).
 The first noticeable increment of time is the first few minutes.  
 I have no study to back this one up, but from my own experience the 1-minute and 5-minute charts are by far the most 
 popular time frame for day traders. 
 Even within the time frame of 1-minute, we can see a number of spikes in price as stocks gap up or down 
 from the previous days close. 

 In this work, I have collected NIFTY50 index for the period of 2012 to 2016. Each month dataset is stored in 
 NIFTY_HistoricalData folder with yearwise subfolders. Shiny app is developed to process and visulize the dataset.
